# World Simulation with JavaFX

## Overview
This project is a world simulation built with Java and JavaFX, where animals move, interact, and reproduce according to predefined rules. The simulation models a dynamic ecosystem where different species compete for survival.

## Features
- Graphical representation of the world using JavaFX.
- Animals move randomly and interact with the environment.
- Reproduction mechanics based on predefined conditions.
- Energy-based survival system.
- Configurable world parameters (e.g., grid size, number of initial animals, reproduction probability).
